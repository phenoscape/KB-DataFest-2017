# Call for Participation:
# Computable evolutionary phenotype knowledge: a hands-on workshop

## Synopsis

Interested in discovering, linking to, recombining, or
computing with machine-interpretable evolutionary phenotypes? 
The [Phenoscape] project is hosting a hands-on
workshop on Dec 11-14, 2017, at Duke University in Durham, North
Carolina.

The goal of the workshop is to foster broader adoption, reuse, and
interoperability of its flagship resource, the Phenoscape Knowledgebase
(KB; <http://kb.phenoscape.org>). The event will bring together a diverse
group of people to collaboratively design and work hands-on on targets
of their interest that take advantage and promote reuse of the KB’s data and
services. The event is designed as a hands-on unconference-style workshop.
Participants will break into subgroups to collaboratively tackle self-selected
work targets.

To apply to participate in the event, please fill out the following form
by Oct 4, 2017: <https://goo.gl/tt18gR>
Travel sponsorship is available but limited, as is space.

Updates will be posted to the workshop repository on Github:
<https://github.com/phenoscape/KB-DataFest-2017>

## About the Phenoscape Knowledgebase (KB)

The Phenoscape KB offers programmable (API) access to natural language phenotype
descriptions annotated with formal ontologies so that machines can understand
and compute with the semantics of descriptions at scale. Currently The KB
contains evolutionary phenotype data from more than 150 comparative morphology
studies, with a focus on the vertebrate fin-to-limb transition and comparative
fish morphology. Using shared ontologies for morphological, spatial, and other
requisite domain knowledge, these data are linked to phenotypes reported in
genetic perturbation studies for pertinent model organisms (zebrafish and
mouse), and to human genetic disease phenotypes.

For query answering the KB uses machine reasoning to match data by its
semantics. The API also gives access to other machine reasoning-based
algorithms. These include synthesizing characters and states that are implied
by but not expressly asserted in the original studies; and finding evolutionary
phenotype transitions semantically similar to gene phenotypes.

Further details, including relevant publications, KB data model, and API
documentation can be found at the workshop wiki:

## Who should participate

We are looking to assemble a diverse group of people, including
developers, computer scientists, data scientists, and domain experts from
a variety of relevant fields, such as evolutionary science, ecology,
biodiversity, biomedical sciences, and bioinformatics. Example personas we are
looking for include, but aren’t limited to the following:
* Software / tool / resource developer
* Data semantics researcher
* Data product developer
* Biology / biodiversity / ecology scientist
* Evolutionary medicine researcher
* Training / documentation specialist
* Visual and data interaction designer

## Background

Efficiently repurposing, integrating, and mining the vast stores
of phenotype data has long been hampered by the limited amount of data
accessible online in standard formats, and by the challenges involved
with enabling machines to compute with data that is largely recorded
in natural language text descriptions. A variety of advances has begun
to address these challenges, including powerful knowledge representation
technologies, shared domain ontologies, very fast machine reasoners, and
various tools accelerating the construction of large databases of
ontology-linked phenotype data. The results emerging from these advances
provide new opportunities for computation-driven data science with
phenotype data, and specifically for natural biodiversity a unique
resource for data science-enabled phenotype descriptions is the
[Phenoscape KB].

## Motivation and Goals

Evolutionary phenotype data that is amenable to computational data science,
including computation-driven discovery, remains relatively new to the field.
Therefore use-cases and applications that effectively exploit these new
capabilities are only beginning to emerge. The overall objective of the
workshop is to foster broader adoption, reuse, and interoperability of
computable phenotype data in general, and of the data in the [Phenoscape KB],
and its machine reasoning capabilities, in particular.

More specifically, the event aims to enable more tools, resources, and
researchers to better integrate with and take advantage of the data and
computational services provided by the KB. As a desired side-effect, this
will ultimately help the Phenoscape team to establish concrete use cases
driven by community needs, inform requirements, and prioritize targets for
future development of the KB, its API, and its services.

## Scope

We are keeping the scope into which work targets at the event are expected to
fall intentionally broad, so as not to limit participants' ideas apriori.
That said, we generally expect work targets to use the data and/or the
computational services of the KB in some way, whether through the API or not.
Possible targets can take many forms. Examples include, but are not limited to
the following:
* Connecting one's data (or database) to the KB (to address a research
  question, or to interconnect a community resource);
* Increasing visibility into the KB data, such as through visualization,
  mashups, or apps;
* Devising resources that make it easier to reuse the KB's data or
  capabilities, for example in the form of vignettes;

In general, work targets that align well with participants’ own professional
interests are generally more desirable than others that do not, because they
typically get more traction, and are more likely to be continued in some way
after the event.
