# Computable evolutionary phenotype knowledge: a hands-on workshop

## Synopsis

Interested in discovering, linking to, recombining, or otherwise
computing with machine-interpretable evolutionary phenotypes extracted
from published studies? The Phenoscape project is holding a hands-on
workshop on Dec 11-14, 2017, at Duke University in Durham, North
Carolina, to foster broader adoption, reuse, and interoperability of
its flagship resource, the Phenoscape Knowledgebase (KB; <http://kb.phenoscape.org>).
The KB offers programmable (API) access to natural language phenotype
descriptions annotated with formal ontologies so that machines can
understand and compute with the semantics of descriptions at
scale. Currently the KB includes data extracted from more than 150
comparative vertebrate morphology studies, integrated with similarly
augmented gene phenotype data drawn from vertebrate model organism
databases. The KB’s API also provides online access to machine
reasoning and other computational semantics algorithms for its data
content, including synthesizing presence/absence character matrices,
and finding evolutionary phenotype transitions semantically similar to
gene phenotypes. The event will bring together a diverse group of
people to collaboratively design and work hands-on on targets of their
interest that take advantage and promote reuse of the KB’s data and
services.

## Motivation

Efficiently repurposing, integrating, and data mining the vast stores
of phenotype data has long been hampered by the limited amount of data
accessible online in standard formats, and by the challenges involved
with enabling machines to compute with data that is largely recorded
in natural language text descriptions. A variety of advances,
including knowledge representation technologies, the development of
shared domain ontologies, and the curation of large databases of
ontology-linked phenotype data, has begun to address these challenges,
providing new opportunities for computation-driven data science with
phenotype data. For natural biodiversity, a unique resource for data
science-enabled phenotype descriptions is the Phenoscape Knowledgebase
(KB; http://kb.phenoscape.org). The KB offers online and programmable
access to phenotype data from more than 150 comparative morphology
studies, focusing on the vertebrate fin-to-limb transition and
comparative fish morphology. Using shared ontologies for
morphological, spatial, and other requisite domain knowledge, these
data are linked to phenotypes reported in genetic perturbation studies
for pertinent model organisms (zebrafish and mouse), and to human
genetic disease phenotypes. Querying the KB uses machine reasoning to
match data by its semantics, and the KB also provides API access to
other algorithms based on machine reasoning, such as synthesizing
characters and states that are implied by but not expressly asserted
in the original studies, and finding evolutionary phenotype
transitions semantically similar to gene phenotypes.

Evolutionary phenotype data augmented in this way is still relatively
new to the field, and therefore use-cases and applications that
effectively exploit the new capabilities are only beginning to
emerge. To foster broader adoption, reuse, and interoperability of the
data in the KB, as well as the machine reasoning capabilities it
implements, Phenoscape is holding a KB Data and Interoperability
Codefest. The event will take place Dec 11-14, 2017, at Duke University
in Durham, North Carolina, and aims to bring together a diverse group
of data scientists, developers, and others interested in
trait-oriented data sets, tools and resources.

## Scope, Goals, and Objectives

The overall objective of the event is to enable more tools, resources,
and researchers to more seamlessly integrate with and take advantage
of both the data in the KB, as well as the computational services it
can provide.  As a consequence, one of the main goals we hope to
accomplish is to establish concrete use cases, inform requirements and
prioritize needs for future development aimed at lowering the barriers
to access to the programmatic and other interfaces to the KB.

We are keeping the scope for target projects at the event that qualify
intentionally broad, so as not to limit ideas we may not have thought
of. Generally speaking, we expect work targets to take advantage of
data in the KB (whether through the API or not), computational
services the KB provides, or increase visibility for and to lower
barriers to (re)using the data content in some other way. Examples
include, but are not limited to the following:
* Developing links from other online resources to data in the KB
* Mashing up KB data with other data
* Integrating KB data and/or services with other tools (whether the necessary API methods exist already or not)
* Developing documentation for using the KB to build a dataset needed or a certain type of research question
* Developing visualization (or visualization apps) that involve or describe KB data

In general, work targets that align well with participants’ own
professional interests, and thus are more likely to be continued in
some way after the event, are the most desirable.

## Who should participate

We are looking to assemble a diverse group of people, including
developers, data scientists, and researchers from a variety of fields
such as evolutionary science, ecology, biodiversity, biomedical
sciences, and bioinformatics. Example personas include, but aren’t
limited to the following:
* Software / tool / resource developer
* Data product developer
* Biology / biodiversity / ecology scientist
* Evolutionary medicine researcher
* Training / documentation specialist
