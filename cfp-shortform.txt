   Computable evolutionary phenotype knowledge: a hands-on workshop


The Phenoscape (http://phenoscape.org) project is hosting a hands-on workshop
on Dec 11-14, 2017, at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

Evolutionary phenotype data that is amenable to computational data science,
including computation-driven discovery, remains relatively new to science.
Therefore use-cases and applications that effectively exploit these new
capabilities are only beginning to emerge. If you are interested in
discovering, linking to, recombining, or computing with machine-interpretable
evolutionary phenotypes, this is the workshop for you! 

The event will bring together a diverse group of people to collaboratively
design and work hands-on on targets of their interest that take advantage and
promote reuse of [Phenoscape]'s online evolutionary data resources and
services. The event is designed as a hands-on unconference-style workshop.
Participants will break into subgroups to collaboratively tackle self-selected
work targets.
